Welcome to my website decvelopment respiratory.

This is the very first time I did a fully funcitonal website.

This is meant for my assignment submission for Multimedia Technology and Application system.

I will attach my report document here so that you guys have an idea where I source all of the reference as well as the reportation standard of it.

It is difficult as it took me 1 month to non stop design, develop and test the web site.

You can view the website here:

To my lecturer that will reveal this respiratory,

In this respiratory, there will only be 1 css file, 6 html files and 1 php files. Also, there will be a folder storing all of the pictures.

As a standard HTML protocol, index.html will be the first primary files.

I hope you have a good day ahead.

Jimmy.
